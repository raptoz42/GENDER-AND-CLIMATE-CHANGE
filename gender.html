            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Climate change and gender are closely connected, with women generally facing greater vulnerability due to their roles and limited resources. However, both men and women experience unique challenges. Gender-sensitive approaches are needed in climate policies to address these differences, ensuring that both men and women can contribute to and benefit from solutions.</p>

        <section id="impact">
            <h2>The Impact of Climate Change on Women</h2>
            <p>Women and men experience the impacts of climate change differently due to social roles, economic status, and access to resources. In many regions, women are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods, which makes them more vulnerable to environmental changes. Additionally, they often bear the brunt of household responsibilities, which are exacerbated during extreme weather events.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of Climate Change on Men</h2>
            <p>Men are often exposed to different risks. In many cultures, men are more likely to work in outdoor professions, such as agriculture, construction, or fishing, which increases their exposure to extreme weather events and environmental hazards. Men are also more likely to migrate in search of work when climate change disrupts local economies, leading to additional physical and mental health risks.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Gender-Responsive Climate Solutions</h2>
            <p>Addressing climate change requires solutions that consider gender disparities. Women's leadership and participation in decision-making are essential for creating effective policies. Empowering women through education, providing access to clean energy, and ensuring women's voices are included in climate negotiations can make climate solutions more effective and sustainable.</p>
